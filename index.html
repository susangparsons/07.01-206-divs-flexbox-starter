                I was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA by second generation immigrants from Norway. I developed most of my sensibilities and interests from this heritage. I have no idea why I identify more closely with my Norwegian culture than that of my Irish and German cultures (on my mom's side).

                My current passion is dance. I've learned bellydance from a broad range of cultures including Egyptian, North African, Turkish, Greek and Lebanese. It's hard to say, but my fav so far is Turkish Romany with Lebanese Debke as a close second. I sort of like Norwegian folk dance, but it's not as spicy as the other folk dances mentioned to the left. 
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">

                Fun fact: I used to eat a box of crackers per day because they're salty and delicious. But after becoming more serious about the energy it takes to dance 2 hrs/day, I cut out that daily habit cold turkey.
